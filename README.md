# Frontend Challenge: Addisonglobal Web Technical Test

This project is part of a [series of frontend challenges](https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges) and was developed following the specifications of the challenge, which can be found at [this link](https://github.com/addisonglobal/web-technical-test).

## Description

This is a simple project that uses the minimum necessary packages for development. I chose not to use a JavaScript framework, as the application is not very interactive and the objective of the challenge was to test skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

I used the Vite tool for development and code compilation. Vite is a fast and flexible build tool that handles code compilation and optimization. Its functions include hot module replacement, code minification, and generation of code that is compatible with older browsers. Vite is a good choice for simple projects that do not require a large framework.

For naming CSS classes, I used the BEM methodology, and for structuring the content, I used semantic HTML. I used ESLint and Prettier to maintain clean and consistent code. I also used Lighthouse to measure website performance and accessibility.
