# Frontend Challenge: Addisonglobal Web Technical Test

This project is part of a [series of frontend challenges](https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges) and was developed following the specifications of the challenge, which can be found at [this link](https://github.com/addisonglobal/web-technical-test). The objective was to test skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. You can check out the live version of the project at [addison-global-2.netlify.app](https://addison-global-2.netlify.app/)

## Description

For this project, I used the minimum necessary packages for development. To keep the code lightweight and focused on the core challenge. I chose not to use a JavaScript framework, as the application is not very interactive.

For code compilation and optimization, I used Vite, a fast and flexible build tool. Vite is ideal for simple projects that don't require a large framework. It includes features like hot module replacement, code minification, and generation of code compatible with older browsers.

To keep the code organized and maintainable, I followed the BEM methodology for naming CSS classes. I also used ESLint and Prettier to maintain clean and consistent code.

In addition, I placed a strong emphasis on website performance and accessibility, using Lighthouse to measure and optimize these key metrics.
